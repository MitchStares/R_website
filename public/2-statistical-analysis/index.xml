      <description>Linear regression is one of the most highly used statistical techniques in all of life and earth sciences. It is used to model the relationship between a response (Y) variable and a explanatory (X) variable. A linear regression is a special case of a linear model whereby both the response and explanatory variables are continuous. The ANOVA we just conducted is still considered as a linear model since the response variable is a linear (additive) combination of the effects of the explanatory variables.</description>

      <description>So far, we have been using linear models which assume that our response variable is continuous. In earth and life sciences (ecology in particular) we are often working with discrete data, such as count data and binomial (presence/absence) data.
The linear models we have been using so far have been assuming a normal (or gaussian) distribution in our data. Generalised linear models (GLMs) allow us to fit alternative distributions to our data in order to more accurately analyse them.</description>
