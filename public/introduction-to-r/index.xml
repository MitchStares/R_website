      <description>IntroductionThis module will provide an introduction into the R statisitical environment, going through the basics of data analysis and graphing for publication quality results.By the end of this module, you should be able to:
Understand and use the R studio working environmentImport and manipulate data filesUndertake linear (ANOVA, regression) and generalised linear (logistic regression) models and associated assumptions/comparisonsUndertake basic multivariate techniques (PCA, MDS)Construct bar plots and scatterplots in ggplotWhat is R?</description>

      <description>There are very quick ways to open R and begin coding, however, having an organised, well-structured working directory in your computer can save you hours of hassle and make your code much easier to share. As biology and data science are becoming increasingly complex many are turning to computer intensive, coding based software (like you!). With this movement in data science and open access, having our code reproducible, transparent and understandable is key.</description>

      <description>Now that we have our folder setup, lets move into R studio and create our project.
The first step when opening a new R studio environment is creating a script or notebook for working in. Scripts are basic text files where all code is executable. Writing non-code in a script requires the use of #’s (which can look messy and confusing) like so:
read.csv(&amp;quot;datafile.csv&amp;quot;) # this code reads a csv (data) file into R.</description>

      <description>Now that we have successfully have a notebook and appropriate working directory, we can start to read in data.
The first thing with R is that working with normal excel files is quite difficult. So we always work with comma separated values or .CSV files. When saving an excel sheet, just save as and select .csv (comma delimited) as the file type. note: .csv’s can only save a single sheet, not the whole excel workbook</description>
