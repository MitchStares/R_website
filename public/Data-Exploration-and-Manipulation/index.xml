      <description>Now that you have setup your R environment and read in your first data set, we can begin to modify and add to our data as necessary.
Now for the majority of this module, we will be working with a package called Tidyverse. Packages are collections of data, R functions and complied code to add extra features outside of the general base R environment. Packages are central to expanding the possibilities of R.</description>

      <description>Now we have become acquainted with our working directories and the R environment, its time to explore our newely imported data. For this, we will be using the weeds dataset.Ensure your data is loaded in and then either use the View() command:
weeds &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;weeds.csv&amp;quot;)View(weeds)# This will open up a new tab to view your dataor click the variable name in the environment window.
This should bring up a separate tab in Rstudio which you should be able to see the 4 columns (weeds, soil, species &amp;amp; flowers.</description>

      <description>Another important aspect of R coding syntax is refering to specific columns. This is done by using a $ sign after specifying our dataset and then calling the column. Like so:
head(weeds$flowers.m3) # This says to run the head() command but only on the flowers.m3 column## [1] 14 17 23 26 35 45Try this with some of the other commands above. Note: Some of them will not work and will show NULL.</description>
