      <description>The first step for conducting an ANOVA in R is to create an ANOVA object. There are two ways of doing this, using the lm() command, and using the aov() command. For simplicity we will be using the aov() command now, but we will get to the lm() object later.
By using the aov() command, we can create an object that tells summary(), plot() or any other commands that the object is specifically for an ANOVA and as such, will be treated as one.</description>

      <description>Once we know our data is normal and we have our aov() object, we can use one of two commands on this object to generate our statistical result. The normal way to do so is to use the anova() command.

      <description>To conduct an two-factor ANOVA is pretty straightforward.
weeds.aov2 &amp;lt;- aov(flowers ~ species + soil, data = weeds) # two-factor anova (without interaction)summary(weeds.aov2)## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&amp;gt;F) ## species 2 2369 1184.3 9.272 0.000436 ***## soil 1 239 238.5 1.867 0.178720 ## Residuals 44 5620 127.7 ## ---## Signif. codes: 0 &amp;#39;***&amp;#39; 0.001 &amp;#39;**&amp;#39; 0.01 &amp;#39;*&amp;#39; 0.05 &amp;#39;.&amp;#39; 0.1 &amp;#39; &amp;#39; 1This example constructs an ANOVA with two factors, but does not include the interaction term.</description>

      <description>All of our analyses so far have showed us that species has an influence on flower abundance. But without conducting an extra test, we cannot be certain which species are statistically significant from each other when it comes to their effect on flower abundance
