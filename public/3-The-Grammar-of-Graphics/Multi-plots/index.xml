ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length)) +geom_point() +facet_grid(.~Species)As you can see, facet_grid() splits our single plot into a number of plots equal to the levels of the factor we specify. The syntax behind facet_grid() specifies our “rows” and “columns” for our plots separated by a ~ tilde.</description>
