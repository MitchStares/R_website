To Do List
- Reference each page with the resources things came from (mostly environmentalcomputing.net)
- Data manipulation - 3_columns - include changing things to numeric, mention how this happens computationally. Change the name to be more reflective of changing columns
- Continue fixing all of the files (data manipulation -> )
- Fix up homepage
- Put an about page for me, the website and uow etc. 
- Put a page of other resources (data carpentry, environmentalcomputing.net etc.)
- Work on website tutorials, manuscript/writing tutorials, GIS tutorials, multivariate tutorials
- Put tags on files for the search bar
- Fix up the index for assumptions and analysis of variance. 
	- include what assumptions are and why they are important. 
- Replot the themes section so all of the themes are smaller and arranged in a grid with text below to show the command. 
- Reorganise the graph section to have the fundamentals, foundations and then each geometric type, then things like time series, animated etc. 
- Add facetting and saving multiple graphs with cowplot, ggpubr, ggarrange, gridextra etc.
- Add drop down function for menu without refreshing page (basically docdock, but preferably without having to change hugo theme)
- Add a section to formatting your code about document outlines. Placing libraries first, then data read in and then data manipulation, analysis and graphs
	- Inlcude the different ways to outline this, by hypothesis, or all at once. 
- ggplot basic syntax page. Make the example code clear that it is just for syntax purposes and will not actually run.
