<p>The first step when opening a new R studio environment or project is creating a script or notebook for working in. Scripts are basic text files where all code is executable. Writing non-code in a script requires the use of #’s (which can look messy and confusing) like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>read.csv(&quot;datafile.csv&quot;) 
# this code reads a csv (data) file into R. The command read.csv requires brackets with the filepath to the file in quotations. 
# in this code, none of the #&#39;s will run. so if I # the read.csv command, it will not run. like so:
# read.csv(&quot;datafile.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>A whole document of the above example can get messy and hard to understand.</p>
<p>In a notebook, we separate normal text from code by inserting “code chunks” (<em>insert &gt; R</em> in the top right of the window). Chunks are specialised areas in the notebook for code only. Chunks separate code from text, making it easier to write notes and read. <em>These tutorials have been written in a notebook</em>.</p>
<p>{{% notice info %}} * To create a notebook or script, simply use the pulldown menus <em>file &gt; new file</em> and select either a script, markdown or notebook one. Then save the document by hitting the disk icon (or <em>file &gt; save</em>) - R studio will prompt you to install some packages to use a notebook. Do so and then read the text in the notebook. Once you understand, then clear everything below the “output:” — area. * As stated above, click the <strong>insert</strong> pulldown menu in the script window and click <strong>R</strong> to insert a code chunk. All code in a notebook must be written in a chunk {{% /notice %}}</p>

<h4>IMPORTANT!</h4>
<ul>
<li>When working in a project, wherever you save your project will become the default “directory”. R will look here for files first. If you want to set your working directory elsewhere, use the below code.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># Only if you have not created a project

setwd(&quot;Drive:/Folder1/Folder2&quot;)

# insert your folders path in the brackets
# this will tell R to look here for files and &quot;generally&quot; save things here as well.
# e.g. C:/Users/Mitch/Documents/R/</code></pre>
<p>{{% notice info %}} After writing your code, you can click <em>run</em>, <em>run selected line(s)</em>, <em>run current chunk</em> or press <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Enter</em> on the line your cursor is on {{% /notice %}} <strong>Get used to this, you will do this ALOT</strong></p>
