<p>Another important aspect of R coding syntax is refering to specific columns. This is done by using a <strong>$</strong> sign after specifying our dataset and then calling the column. Like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(weeds$flowers.m3) # This says to run the head() command but only on the flowers.m3 column</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 14 17 23 26 35 45</code></pre>
<p>Try this with some of the other commands above. <em>Note: Some of them will not work and will show NULL. This is because these are designed to view aspects of the data frame (e.g. names() )</em></p>
<p><strong>Now we know how to refer to a column, we can fix any issues with importing incorrect data</strong></p>
<p>Pretend for a moment our data was input incorrectly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>weeds$species&lt;-factor(weeds$species)</code></pre>
<p>This would simply save the command <code>factor()</code> on the column species to our weeds object.</p>
<p>If we wanted an ordered factor, e.g. small &lt; medium &lt; large we can use the following</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## example dataset ##
sizes &lt;- factor(c(&quot;small&quot;, &quot;large&quot;, &quot;large&quot;, &quot;small&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;)) # creating a single column factor with 3 levels
sizes</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] small  large  large  small  medium medium
## Levels: large medium small</code></pre>
<p>Here we have just created a new example dataset which consists of a single column, containing the words: small, large and medium in a random order.</p>
<p>We can order these into a logical order, so R will know that medium is bigger than small and large is bigger than medium</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sizes &lt;- ordered(sizes, levels = c(&quot;small&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;large&quot;)) # ordering levels from small through to large.
# Note: I did not need to specify column as this is a single column dataset. 
sizes # Now the factor is ordered.</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] small  large  large  small  medium medium
## Levels: small &lt; medium &lt; large</code></pre>
<p>We can then do this with our weeds dataset, ordering them in a nonsensical order.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>weeds$species&lt;-ordered(weeds$species, levels=c(&quot;Pultenaea&quot;, &quot;Olearia&quot;, &quot;Coprosma&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>This is useful when the dataset you are working with has an ordered factor.</p>
<p><strong>The main use for this is in graphing</strong></p>
<p>By default, R will always sort in alphabetical order, which can be a pain when graphing. If you want ordered factors, or want to present factors along an X axis in a more logical order then the <code>ordered()</code> command or even <code>factor()</code> command where you specify levels is a good option.</p>
<p>{{% notice tip %}} I recommend using the <strong>factor()</strong> command and specifying the levels using the same syntax as the <strong>ordered()</strong> command unless your factor is truely ordered. This way we just sort the factor the way we want, but are not messing with the way R views our variable (as an ordinal variable rather than a logically ordered factor). {{% /notice %}}</p>
<p>If you want to change something to a continuous (numeric, integer etc.) its a little more complicated, but in general R shouldn’t mess this up too often. A quick google search or <code>?numeric</code> will help answer this.</p>
<p>Once we can reference to specific columns we can do interesting things like plot a quick graph.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(weeds$flowers.m3 ~ weeds$soil) # This says to plot a graph with flowers.m3 by (~) soil. </code></pre>
<p><img src="/1-Data-Exploration-and-Manipulation/3_columns_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code># You should get a box and whisker plot.  

hist(weeds$flowers.m3) # hist() is a command that only works on numeric (continuous) columns, and will show you a histogram</code></pre>
<p><img src="/1-Data-Exploration-and-Manipulation/3_columns_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Try replacing the column names in the <strong>plot()</strong> command to see what types of graphs you get. We will return to graphing at a later date, but this is a quick and easy way to view your data.</p>
<p>{{% notice question %}} <strong>Using the plot() command with the insecticide dataset answer the following question:</strong><br />
<strong>Question: What fragment size has a species richness outlier? (according to the box &amp; whisker plot)</strong><br />
{{% /notice %}} {{% expand %}} <strong>Small</strong> {{% /expand %}}</p>
