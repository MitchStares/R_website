title: Customising your graph
weight: 34
---
So far, we have explore some basic plots and functions of ggplot. But, we have not explored how truly powerful and customisable ggplot is. 
This section is designed to show you a wealth of customisable options for the general appearance of your graph. Alot of this section is code-heavy and can get quite overwhelming but thankfully, alot of the code is repetitive. So remember, take a break, grab a coffee and proceed through the customisation section at your own pace. Alot of this isn't critical to producing a simple graph and you can move on to the next section of plotting at any time.
