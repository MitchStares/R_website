<p>To start, we will use the iris dataset that is built into tidyverse/ggplot2. To view the dataset, use the <code>View()</code> command like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>View(iris)</code></pre>
<p>Once we have this, let’s setup a basic boxplot of some of the features of <strong>iris</strong>.</p>
<p>The iris dataset is built into tidyverse/ggplot2. The dataset is a pretty famous dataset by Edgar Anderson that gives the sepal length, width and petal length and width for three species of iris (n=50).</p>
<p>We are going to begin by plotting the sepal length for each species in a basic boxplot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iris.box &lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species,y=Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot()

iris.box # We have to run a line with the name of the plot object to view the graph. </code></pre>
<p><img src="/3-The-Grammar-of-Graphics/2_basicplots_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /> So far, pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>You will notice I saved the ggplot() graph to an object called <strong>iris.box</strong>. Because I saved the plot to an object, I have to run the object name to view the plot. This is identical to using the command <code>print(iris.box)</code>.</p>
<p>{{% notice note %}} ggplot graphs do no need to be saved as an object. You can run all of the commands singularly or as a group. The graph will still be produced. I personally prefer to save them to an object. {{% /notice %}}</p>
<p>Now let’s look at some others, such as a <strong>histogram.</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>iris.hist &lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram()

iris.hist</code></pre>
<p><img src="/3-The-Grammar-of-Graphics/2_basicplots_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>That’s pretty ugly, but a simple addition of <strong>binwidth=“value”</strong> will fix that. Binwidth refers to the width of each bin, or bar, in the frequency histogram. A bin width of 0.5 means each bar of the histogram will be equal to 0.5 on the x axis (e.g. 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5 etc).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iris.hist &lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)

iris.hist</code></pre>
<p><img src="/3-The-Grammar-of-Graphics/2_basicplots_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now let’s look at a <strong>scatterplot</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iris.scatter &lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length,y=Petal.Length)) + 
  geom_point()

iris.scatter</code></pre>
<p><img src="/3-The-Grammar-of-Graphics/2_basicplots_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The cool thing we can do with scatterplots is colour the points by a categorical feature such as Species. This is done by adding <strong>colour = “categorical variable name”</strong> in the aes brackets of the <code>ggplot()</code> command.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iris.scatter &lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, colour=Species)) +
  geom_point()
iris.scatter</code></pre>
<p><img src="/3-The-Grammar-of-Graphics/2_basicplots_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Much better. And it even adds a legend for us.</p>
<p>Now we have this basic setup, we can start adding things to our graph. Due to the immense amount of customisations for our graphs, I will break these down in to sections as much as possible and explain as I go. We will work with the iris dataset for a while before moving to our analysed datasets.</p>
