<p>Normality can be tested in two basic ways. Through visual inspection of residuals in a normal quantile (QQ) plot and histogram, OR, through a mathematical test such as a shapiro-wilks test.</p>
<p>To produce the two graphs for visual inspection of residuals we use the following commands:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(weeds.aov, 2) # Normal quantile plot</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2-Statistical-Analysis/Analysis-of-Variance/Assumptions/1_Normality_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The normal qq plot should display the residuals along the dotted line in a straight manner. In this example, it is pretty straight :)</p>
<p>Plotting the <code>aov()</code> object will generate 4 plots. The QQ plot is the second, so we can just specify the second one to avoid the other 3.</p>
<p>Try removing the 2 and comma and see what the plot command does on its own. It does this because it is being applied to a statistical object (i.e. <code>aov()</code> ).</p>
<p>{{% notice %}} The plot command (without specifying 1-4) may require you to press “ENTER” in the console for each plot. Make sure to look in the console after running this command {{% /notice %}}</p>
<p>We can also produce a histogram of the residuals:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(weeds.aov$residuals) # Histogram of residuals</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2-Statistical-Analysis/Analysis-of-Variance/Assumptions/1_Normality_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>To produce a histogram of the residuals, we simply need to specify the residuals column of our <code>aov()</code> object. Simple!</p>
<p>The reason this works is because the <code>aov()</code> object contains its own column for residuals (amongst other things). Try running <code>str()</code> on weeds.aov to see what columns it contains. The second one should be the residuals.</p>
<p>Something “fun” to do, is to combine both of the graphs in the same window. This produces the same style of output we would get in JMP.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## This may not work in a default notebook ##

par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # This code put two plots in the same window
hist(weeds.aov$residuals)
plot(weeds.aov, 2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2-Statistical-Analysis/Analysis-of-Variance/Assumptions/1_Normality_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>{{% notice warning %}} If your using a notebook, the par() command wont work. Click the settings cog and select “chunk output in console”.<br />
If your future graphs keep using this two plot window, use the following command in the console to stop it. <code>dev.off()</code> {{% /notice %}}</p>
<p>Running a shapiro-wilks test is a similar story. To produce a shapiro-wilks test requires the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>shapiro.test(weeds.aov$residuals) # run a shapiro-wilks test on the residuals column of our anova object using the shapiro.test() function</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Shapiro-Wilk normality test
## 
## data:  weeds.aov$residuals
## W = 0.98282, p-value = 0.6993</code></pre>
<p>With a shapiro-wilks test, if the result is significant, this means our data is NOT-NORMAL. In our case our data is normal.<br />
You should be aware that the shapiro-wilks test is very sensitive to departures from normality and is often considered a “harsh” test. There are many other options for testing normality through an empirical test. Most people prefer to stick with visual inspections of residuals to avoid this.</p>
