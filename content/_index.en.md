# Staring At R 

This site is a series of self-guided tutorials on using the R statistical package for data manipulation, analysis and visualisation including the following:  

* Downloading and installing R & Rstudio  
* Setting up your file system and working environment in a reproducable manner  
* Manipulating your data in a reproducable manner  
* Statistical analysis, covering analysis of variance, linear regressions and generalised linear models (more to come!)  
* Visualisation of your results in a clear and customisable manner  

The initial focus of this site is data science techniques for ecology based research, however, this will hopefully improve in scope in the future. Tutorials have initially been developed as part of a teaching module for undergraduate students in the School of Biology at the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/index.html) but have been expanded beyond that initial development.

Special thanks to [Associate Professor Alistair Poore](https://alistairpoore.org) & [Associate Professor Will Cornwell](http://willcornwell.org/) for their advice and excellent work on [Environmental Computing](http://environmentalcomputing.net/), which is was a huge inspiration and resource during the development of this site.

**Disclaimer:** This site has been developed soley by Mitchell Stares, a PhD candidate in forest ecology at the University of Wollongong. Material for this site has been partly developed as material for an undergraduate subject at the University of Wollongong, while under employment as an associate lecturer. Mitchell holds no qualifications or certifications in statisitics, mathematics or computer science. Knowledge has stemmed from years of coding in R, self-taught through tutorials, textbooks and colleagues. Many of the resources for this site have been adapted from multiple online websites, and references to each of those websites will be updated shortly.
