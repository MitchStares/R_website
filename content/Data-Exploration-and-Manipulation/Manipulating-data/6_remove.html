<p>By now, we have quite a few objects in our R environment that aren’t being used. The <strong>remove()</strong> command does exactly that….removes objects from the R environment. This helps for making things nice and tidy, specifically in our environment window.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remove(frogfull, froginner, enviro_filter) # Removes all three objects we just generated</code></pre>
<p>Use this in the console to “one off” remove an item.</p>
<p>… that’s all, NEXT!</p>
