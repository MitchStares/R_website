<p>This is an extremely useful function that lets you create different summaries of columns. You can also nest other functions within it to apply them to your columns.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum_data &lt;- summarise(weeds, mean(flowers))  # We&#39;ll start simple. Generates the mean of the flower column

sum_data &lt;- summarise(group_by(weeds, species), mean(flowers)) 
# Using the group_by() function within summarise lets you get summaries for groups, in this case &quot;species&quot;

sum_data &lt;- summarise(group_by(weeds,species, soil), mean(flowers), sd(flowers), se=sd(flowers/sqrt(n())))
# Grouped by with species &amp; soil, generating mean, standard deviation &amp; standard error of flowers</code></pre>
<p>The last example generates the mean, sd and se for each factor combination in our dataset. This is pretty useful, particularly for generating bar graphs.</p>
<p>However, its a little complex and can be in a much nicer format.</p>
