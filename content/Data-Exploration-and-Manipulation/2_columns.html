<h4>2) Changing Columns</h4>
<p>Another important aspect of R coding syntax is refering to specific columns. This is done by using a <strong>$</strong> sign after specifying our dataset and then calling the column. Like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(weeds$flowers.m3) # This says to run the head() command but only on the flowers.m3 column</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 14 17 23 26 35 45</code></pre>
<p>Try this with some of the other commands above. <em>Note: Some of them will not work and will show NULL. This is because these are designed to view aspects of the data frame (e.g. names() )</em></p>
<p><strong>Now we know how to refer to a column, we can fix any issues with importing incorrect data</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code># Pretend for a moment our data was input incorrectly
weeds$species&lt;-factor(weeds$species) # this would simply save the command factor() on the column species to our weeds object.

# If we wanted an ordered factor, e.g. small &lt; medium &lt; large we can use the following
    #example dataset
sizes &lt;- factor(c(&quot;small&quot;, &quot;large&quot;, &quot;large&quot;, &quot;small&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;)) # creating a single column factor with 3 levels
sizes</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] small  large  large  small  medium medium
## Levels: large medium small</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>sizes &lt;- ordered(sizes, levels = c(&quot;small&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;large&quot;)) # ordering levels from small through to large.
# Note: I did not need to specify column as this is a single column dataset. 
sizes # Now the factor is ordered.</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] small  large  large  small  medium medium
## Levels: small &lt; medium &lt; large</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>weeds$species&lt;-ordered(weeds$species, levels=c(&quot;Pultenaea&quot;, &quot;Olearia&quot;, &quot;Coprosma&quot;)) # This is an example with our data set, but this is nonsensical ordering so dont do this</code></pre>
<p>By default, R will always sort in alphabetical order, which can be a pain when graphing. If you want ordered factors, or want to present factors along an X axis in a more logical order then the <strong>ordered()</strong> command or even <strong>factor()</strong> command where you specify levels is a good option.</p>
<p>If you want to change something to a continuous (numeric, integer etc.) its a little more complicated, but in general R shouldn’t mess this up too often. A quick google search or <strong>?numeric</strong> will help answer this.</p>
<p>Once we can reference to specific columns we can do interesting things like plot a quick graph.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(weeds$flowers.m3 ~ weeds$soil) # This says to plot a graph with flowers.m3 by (~) soil. </code></pre>
<p><img src="/Data-Exploration-and-Manipulation/2_columns_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code># You should get a box and whisker plot.  

hist(weeds$flowers.m3) # hist() is a command that only works on numeric (continuous) columns, and will show you a histogram</code></pre>
<p><img src="/Data-Exploration-and-Manipulation/2_columns_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Try replacing the column names in the <strong>plot()</strong> command to see what types of graphs you get. We will return to graphing at a later date, but this is a quick and easy way to view your data.</p>
<p><strong>Using the plot() command with the insecticide dataset answer the following question:</strong><br />
<strong>Question: What fragment size has a species richness outlier? (according to the box &amp; whisker plot)</strong></p>
<p>{1:SHORTANSWER: =Small}</p>
