All statistical tests need to make various assumptions about your data when conducting the test. This is due to the algorithms at work assuming your data fits specific distributions, has equal variances and your replicates are independant of one another (not spatially autocorrelated). Any violations of these assumptions can cause the test to produce a false-positive, as an analysis of variance is sensitive to violations in the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance (also called homoscedasticity). 
These pages cover the basic ways to test these assumptions on your analysis of variance to ensure any statistical findings are correct and not confounded by violations in the basic assumptions.
